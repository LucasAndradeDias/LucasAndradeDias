Hi. My name is Lucas, I am 21 years old from Brasi. I'm currently working on cloud based projects at @alest, using the cloud I most love to use 'Google Cloud'. I've been on computer sience since my 8 years using (Acer TravelMate), where with 12 years I started a little company to fix computers in my family. After it, started coding at 15 years old just to find out how things like Youtube, google, Television, etc, was built. And I have no stop to find out about how tech stuffs are made.
